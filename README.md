Healthcare is more crucial to begin a good life. However, obtaining a doctor's
consultation in the event of a health problem is quite difficult. The proposed concept is to
use Artificial Intelligence to construct a health care chatbot system that can diagnose
diseases and deliver basic information about them before contacting a doctor. The
technology offers text support and allows you to communicate with the bot in a
user-friendly manner. The bot will tell you what type of sickness you have based on your
symptoms and the doctor data that emerge in relation to your disease analgesics. It will
also give you diet suggestions, which indicates what kind of food you should eat. The
chatbot will ask a series of questions to clarify the user's symptoms, and the symptom
confirmation will be completed. The sickness will be divided into two categories: minor
and major. If it is a significant disease, the chatbot will provide the user with the contact
information for a doctor as well as analgesics for further treatment.

Our concept is to develop an AI-powered health care chatbot system that can
diagnose diseases and provide basic information about them before contacting a
doctor. This allows people to learn more about their ailment and enhance their
overall health. The user can obtain all kinds of disease information.
To respond to user enquiries, the system application employs a question and
response protocol in the form of a chatbot. The answer to the question will depend
on the user's request. The important keywords are extracted from the sentence and
used to answer those sentences. If a match is found, a substantial response will be
provided, or comparable responses will be displayed.
Based on user symptoms, the bot will diagnose the type of sickness you have and
provide doctor details, analgesics, and nutritional recommendations. Using this
application system, they may be able to lessen their health problems.
The method was created to help consumers save money and time on healthcare
because they are unable to visit doctors or specialists when they are in need.
